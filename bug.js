This error typically arises when the Expo CLI attempts to interact with a project's package.json file, but encounters an unexpected structure or content within that file.  This can manifest in a few ways, including missing dependencies, incorrectly formatted JSON, or unexpected characters within the file.

Example Scenario:
Suppose a character, like a stray comma or bracket, exists in the package.json file that violates the JSON syntax rules. The Expo CLI, upon parsing, would encounter a JSON parsing error and halt the process, resulting in the cryptic message or error codes.

Another possibility is an incorrect version or inconsistency among the project's dependencies declared in the package.json file and what the Expo CLI or other build tools expect. This mismatch may cause problems such as an inability to resolve modules or conflicts between package versions.
