To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Validate `package.json`:** Use a JSON validator (many online tools are available) to check your `package.json` for any syntax errors.  Common problems include missing commas, extra brackets, or incorrect quoting. Correct any identified errors.

2. **Check Dependencies:** Review the dependencies listed in your `package.json`. Ensure they are correctly specified, including version numbers.  Look for any conflicts or inconsistencies between the listed versions and those actually installed in your project's `node_modules` directory.  You might use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate dependency trees.

3. **Clean and Reinstall:**  Try cleaning your project's cache and reinstalling dependencies: 
    * `npm cache clean --force` (or `yarn cache clean`)
    * `npm install` (or `yarn install`)

4. **Create a new `package.json`:** As a last resort, if you can't pinpoint the error, create a completely new `package.json` file.  Start with a minimal version, including only the essential dependencies, and gradually add others while testing after each addition.

5. **Examine the error logs:** Expo CLI should provide further details in its error output.  Try to carefully interpret those details to find the root cause of the JSON parsing error.
