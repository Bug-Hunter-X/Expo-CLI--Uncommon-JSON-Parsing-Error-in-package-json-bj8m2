# Expo CLI: Uncommon JSON Parsing Error in package.json

This repository demonstrates a scenario where an uncommon JSON parsing error occurs during the use of Expo CLI. The error relates to issues within the project's `package.json` file, such as malformed JSON, missing dependencies, or version conflicts. 

## Problem Description
The Expo CLI may fail unexpectedly with a generic JSON parsing error when it tries to read `package.json`.  The error message is often not very specific, making it difficult to debug.

## Solution
Carefully examine the `package.json` file for syntax errors (stray commas, brackets etc.). Ensure all dependencies and versions are correctly declared and compatible. Using a JSON validator tool can be beneficial to check the validity of the `package.json` file.
